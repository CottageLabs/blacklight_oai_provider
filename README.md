# Blacklight OAI-PMH Provider

## This repository is out of date. 

This repository was originally forked to provide further filtering customisations to derive the OAI-PMH document list from SOLR in the form of  _set_filters_, _record_filters_ and _format_filters_ (as documented in https://github.com/CottageLabs/blacklight_oai_provider/wiki/Configuring-the-OAI-PMH-service).

Please use the official blacklight oai provider gem: https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight_oai_provider for integrating OAI with [Blacklight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight).

if you would like to retain the customisations, they are now available at [https://github.com/CottageLabs/projectblacklight_blacklight_oai_provider/tree/customize_oai_provider](https://github.com/CottageLabs/projectblacklight_blacklight_oai_provider/tree/customize_oai_provider). See [pull request](https://github.com/CottageLabs/projectblacklight_blacklight_oai_provider/pull/1) for status.
